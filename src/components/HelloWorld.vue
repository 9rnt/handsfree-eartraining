    <h2>This website is dedicated to ear training and music theory exercises</h2>
    <p>
      These exercises do not require you to be looking at the phone during the exercise and after setting up the excercise parameters, answeres will be annouced 3 seconds after the notes has been played. You can use this website when you exercise or walk.
